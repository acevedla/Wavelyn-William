    <h1>Dear <span class="highlight">Wavelyn</span> and <span class="highlight">William</span>,</h1>

    <p>It has been a privilege to meet, live and learn with both of you. You have been a ray of sunshine in my life and I am so fortunate to have had you in my life. I want you to know that I care deeply for both of you and that I will miss you. Goodbyes are sad sometimes, but they are a part of life. We just have to be grateful that we were able to meet and have fun together, I know that I am. Now that I am not there, both of you need to take care of your mom as well as each other. Family is so important, make sure to cherish yours.</p>

    <p class="important">Wavelyn - Continue to be your fun, happy silly self. Every time you got back home from school or on the weekends, you made me smile with your energy and love for life. Continue to push yourself in school, you have improved so much! I am so proud of you, and I am excited for your continued growth into a smart, kind, fun-loving teenager. I believe that you can do anything you put your mind to. Thank you for letting me be a part of your life.</p>

    <p class="important">William - You have grown so much since the first time I met you! I now see a William that is curious about the world and how it works. I also see a kind human being that gets frustrated sometimes. I want to encourage you to keep being curious and to continue building things. Do things that are hard and understand that frustration is normal. What matters is how you deal with that frustration. Don't take it out on others, and like rollerblading, conquer the things you put your mind to. Thank you for letting me be a part of your life.</p>

    <p>I want both of you to continue to love each other and be there for each other. Life will throw curveballs at you, but together you can overcome any obstacles. Having a brother or sister there for you is a blessing you will cherish for life. I am so happy I’ve been able to see a small part of that journey.</p>

    <p>Maybe our paths will cross again, but until then I have to say goodbye. I love you both.</p>
